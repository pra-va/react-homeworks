      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput <br />
    UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs <br />
    Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph
    texts of your choice)<br />
    Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it
    there<br />
    Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to
    the UserOutput component<br />
    Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)<br />
    Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind
    it to the input-change event<br />
    Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username
    passed to UserOutput<br />
    Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the
    starting username<br />
    Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components -
    both with inline styles and stylesheets<br />
